Fizz  Buzz
=========

This is an implementation of one of the easiest code katas out there, the Fizz Buzz game.

Rules are super simple, count number one after another but when the number:

* is dividable **by 3 say Fizz**
* is dividable **by 5 say Buzz**
* is dividable **by 3 and 5 say Fizz Buzz**

simple as that.

This is a demo of combining ASP.NET MVC + WebApi2 + AutoFac + XUnit + FluentAssertions + Less + AngularJS + Twitter Bootstrap

Lot of stuff but it all boils down to:

**Angular JS** for UI that feetches the data from **WebAPI** rest is just some toys and tools around. Nothing to be scared of :)
